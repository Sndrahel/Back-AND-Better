## Five Planes:

#### - Strategy (What this website aims to achive, and for whom.)

The website aims to offer visually appealing and accesible information, that is requested by user stories. The main goal of the website is to attract women to to fill out the contact form.  

#### - Scope (Which features, based on information from the strategy plane, do you want to include in your design?)

<em>To make the site easy to use and accessible, it should be properly.</em> 

#### - Structures (How is the information structured and how is it logically grouped?)

Pages: Home, About, Contact

- The home page 
- The about page 
- The contact page is a clean and simple contact-us form. 

#### - Skeleton (How will our information be represented, and how will the user navigate to the information and the features?)
###### Wireframes:

- [Desktop_Home_page]()
- [Mobile_Home_page]()
- [Desktop_About_page]()
- [Mobile_About_page]()
- [Desktop_Contact_page]()
- [Mobile_Contact_page]()

#### - Surface (What will the finished product look like? - What colors, typography, and design elements will we use?)

I have used a background image of a face painted girl who lifts a barbell for the home, about and contact page. I have tried to reuse the colors from the image through out the rest of the website.
